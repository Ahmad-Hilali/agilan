= Introduction =

Architectural specs corresponding/mapped to high-level specs.

----
myerman: My initial thought is that most of the modules should have a user_id so we can keep track of who has created bookmark, made status update, shared file, or blogged. All of these should also have a created timestamp and a tag field.

That way, users can always see who has created something. We can also do things like adding "user x has just uploaded file y" in the status updates to keep employees up to speed on activities. We can also use the tags to do subscriptions and searches.

Your thoughts?
